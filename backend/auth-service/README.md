FridgeMate is a web-based application (with potential integration to mobile platforms) designed to serve as a virtual fridge for students. It helps users manage their food inventory, track expiration dates, and make efficient use of ingredients. The project uses a microservice architecture and includes a neural network-based recommendation system for suggesting recipes.
